	<p>Have your received your written order for PCS or TDY?  If so, you have 3 options for performing your move. 

    	<ol>
    		<li>Full Service Move:  TMO / JPPSO will make arrangements with contracted carrier to move your property.  This is a traditional move.</li>
    		<li>Full DITY:  The service member can make arrangements and move at their own expense and be reimbursed by the government.</li>
    		<li>Partial DITY:  A combination of the two options above.</li>
    		</ol>
    	</p>

	<p><b>Under the DITY or PPM program service members can receive reimbursement up to 100% of the Government constructive Cost for hiring their own carrier, or up to 95% of the Government Constructive Cost for moving their own property.</b></p>

	<p>To make a successful DITY Move follow these basic steps:

    	<ol>
    		<li>Contact your local TMO or JPPSO office.</li>
    		<li>Choose from options for a DITY move</li>
    		<li>Make Move</li>
    		<li>File for reimbursement from the government</li>
    		</ol>
    	</p>

	<p><b>Most importantly when considering a DITY move, make proper arrangements with a TMO or JPPSO office.  Your local TMO or JPPSO office can provide you with a quote of the reimbursement you will receive from the government. </b></p>
